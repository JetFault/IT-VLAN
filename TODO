  - If no TAP device specified in config, use eth0 mac addr. Read it from /sys/class/net/eth0/address
  - Membership List
  - Forwarding Table
  - Routing Graph
  - Routing
    + The membership list and link state list will be used to generate a directed graph.
    + You will use the graph to generate a forwarding table for the given proxy.
    + You should use shortest path routing where the link cost is the RTT in milliseconds. 
  - Network Measurement and Link Cost.
    + RTT will be measured every 1 second by:
      - Measuring the time between a sent probe request packet and probe response packet.
      - The RTT will be included in the link state between the peers. 
      - The RTT is computed by:
        + Taking a timestamp
        + Sending probe request 
        + Waiting for the probe response
        + Recording the difference in time
  - Maintaining the Membership list.
    + Every linkPeriod seconds a proxy will send a link state packet, which contains all the
        link-state records it owns, to all connected proxies. 
      - These linkstate records are flooded throughout the system.
    + If a proxy receives a leave packet
      - If it has not seen this ID yet
        + It should:
          - Send a leave message to all the connected proxies
          - Close all the sockets for that peer
          - Then exit. (This means nothing to me...?)
      - Proxies receiving a leave packet will remove that particular proxy from the membership list. 
    + The membership list should be periodically scanned to remove stale entries.
      - When no link state record for a proxy has been received for linkTimeout seconds.

  - Add currently open sockets to linkstate list
  - Route packets to appropriate end host
  - ID should be current time in milliseconds
  - Create a Client and Server socket
  - Server
    + Accept a connection
      - Wait for for a 1 record linkstate packet
      - If the first packet is not a single record link state packet,
        + the proxy will close the connection.
      - If it is, it adds the client in the to the membership list.
      - The server then generates it's own link state packet and sends over same socket
      - The RTT should be set to 1 and the ID set to the current time.
  - Client
    + Connect to all your peers
  - Actions on Linkstate Packet Arrival
    + For each record in the packet,
      - Receiver checks the local and remote MAC addresses against itâ€™s membership list.
        + If either is not on this list
          - the receiving proxy tries to connect to the reported IP address in the record.
            + If this connect() call  fails, the two proxiesi remain disconnected. 
        + If they are in your membership list
          - Check if ID is > old ID.
            + If yes, replace old linkstate with this newer one
            + Else, discard
  - Flooding Link State Records. 
    + Each link state record is unique, but whole sets of records will be transferred between 
        pairs of proxies in bulk.
    + Upon receiving a neighbor's link state records,
      - Check for duplicates in link state list using the MAC and ID fields as unique identifiers
      - Update the list accordingly
    + Every 10 seconds a proxy will send its' link state records to the neighboring connected proxies. 
          

  - Taking down the whole VLAN
    + If a node receives a quit packet.
      - Forward it to all connected peers
      - Close all the sockets
      - Then exit




- Flow Logic -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Waiting for connecting proxies on the listening TCP port. 
  2. Reading packets from the local interface and forwarding them to the correct remote proxy via TCP. 
  3. Reading packets from the TCP socket of a connected proxy and forwarding them to the local interface,
      or routing them to the correct peer proxy's TCP socket (for part 3).
  4. Periodically: 
    1. Checking for expired membership list and link state entries.
    2. Sending link state packets.
    3. Sending probe packets to measuring the link (for part 3).
    4. Updating the routing graph (for part 3).
